// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for number n
If n mod 2 is not equal to 0, print odd
Else print even


If n%2 != 0
print("odd")

Else
print("even") 


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) ask for 5 numbers (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5)
B) add all 5 numbers together. Then divide sum by 5 
C) min = n1
	for i = 2 to 5
	if n1 > ni then: min = ni
   max = n1
	for i = 2 to 5
	if n1 < ni then: max = ni
D) (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 = average of the 5 integers
   Min = ni which is the smallest number from the 5 integers
   Max = ni which is the largest number from the 5 integers
